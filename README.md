# GeneticAlgo
A Python implementation of a genetic algorithm (using NumPy).

I'm currently working on hooking up the backend to the GUI with PyQt. Once the gui is finished, I will optimize the code for speed.

Note: ignore the "test" branch, I'm just using that to upload my virtual env and some other stuff so that I can download it on other machines.
