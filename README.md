# GeneticAlgo
A Python implementation of a genetic algorithm (using NumPy).

I'm currently working on hooking up the backend to the GUI with PyQt. Once the gui is finished, I will optimize the code for speed.

Note: most of the current work on this is done in the "test" branch, because I've uploaded the virtual env I'm using as well, and I'm also going to try some other stuff and I'm not going to add it to the master branch until I've figured out which parts I want to add.
